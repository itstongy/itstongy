# Hi, I’m Harrison 👋

Heres some small, practical tools that make day-to-day life smoother.

## Tools

- ☕ **[Coffee Grinder Dialer](https://itstongy.github.io/CoffeeGrindDialer/)** — a retro-inspired espresso shot logger + grinder dial-in helper (static site; persists via `localStorage`).  

- 🍽️ **[Weekly Meal Planner](https://itstongy.github.io/WeeklyMealPlanner/)** — lightweight, client-side meal planning for two people (extendable): attendance tracking, leftovers logic, suggestions, meal library, and exports (JSON/CSV/ICS).  

- 🌧️ **[bom-nowcast](https://github.com/itstongy/Bom-NowCast)** — Node.js CLI that fetches BOM radar frames over HTTPS, renders a human-friendly loop (with emoji pins), and runs a basic nowcast/ETA.  

- 💊 **[Days Since (for Pharmacists)](https://itstongy.github.io/Days-Since-for-Pharmacists/)** — quick “days since supply” calculator with optional tablets/day and a visual gauge (static site; works great with a browser search shortcut).
